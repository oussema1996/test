# Data Pipeline
This pipeline is my work for a Python et Data Engineering technical test.
This pipeline is based on the ideas of ETL:
Extracting data - - Transforming Data -- Loading Data.

# Project Organisation
- input Directory: contain the input files that these pipeline threats.
- ./input/input_description: contain Jsons file that you can find the explanation for in "Compte-rendu.pdf"
- logs Directory: Contain two files ( error_log.text, pipeline_log) where the user cans see the logs and error if any was raised after running the code
- Output Directory: contain two files (Output_ad_hoc.Txt , Output_pipline.json) the first is the result of the ad-hoc processing task and the second is a json demanded to describe the Result of the pipeline
- SQl: contain my work the SQL part.
- Extractor.py : Class that define the Extraction job.
- Transformer.py : Class that define the Transformer job.
- main.py
- Compte-rendu.pdf : file with explanation of the approach  

# Run The Project
Clone the project change directory to test and  run main.py
